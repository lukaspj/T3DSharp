# T3DSharp - A C# scripting layer for Torque3D

This project consists of two parts:

* T3DSharpFramework
* T3DSharpGenerator

The _framework_ is a library of basic functionality and definitions necessary to interop with Torque3D nicely.

The _generator_ generates the class library by analysing the EngineAPI XML Export that Torque3D can produce.

Please see the `docs` folder for how to setup this project to run with your T3D code.
